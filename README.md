Does coding ever feel heavy to you? You have a brilliant idea for an app, but then gravity kicks in. You have to set up the environment, configure the database, write the boilerplate, and debug the dependencies. Suddenly, your "quick idea" is a weekend-long project …
But what if you could turn off that gravity?
I recently challenged myself to build a simple accounting software prototype in under 60 seconds. I didn't use a complex framework or spend hours on StackOverflow. I used Google Anti Gravity application to generate a "zero-gravity" tech stack: HTML5, PHP, SQLite, and Docker.
